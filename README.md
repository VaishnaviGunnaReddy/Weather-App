# Weather-App
This Weather App provides real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. Inspired by similar apps, it adds a feature to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit for temperature, as well as wind speed units. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it displays temperature, humidity, and weather icons, while being responsive and user-friendly.
